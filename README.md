This a repo for some small php project I have done during my web engineering course. These codes are for reference that will help in building bigger projects.

# 1. Food Order Registration:
## Problem Statement:
An online food ordering website helps a user get food delivered to them via courier from
the users expected restaurant. But to use to the system the user must first register
through the online registration system of the website where the user must provide
information’s such as First name Middle name Last name, address, email, contact
number, preferred transaction method(Bkash, Visa, Rocket), Type of service(Regular,
Express, Platinum) etc. Once these information’s are provided, then the user will be able
to submit the information and then get registered. The registered user’s information will
need to be stored in the database. All the information needs to be validated (form
validation) before entering into the database. Now, write the required scripts using PHP
and HTML for front and backend and MYSQL for database to implement the system. Make
sure to name the frontend file as yourname_yourId.php (ex: rayhan_04118.php) and
name the database as yourdept_yourName( ex: CSE_rohan). It is mandatory to use this
format.
